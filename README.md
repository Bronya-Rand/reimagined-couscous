# Weiss' Pyg Chatbot Archive

Why hello there! Welcome to this collection of bots that I decided to create out of fun (and as a challenge) for the AI model "PygmalionAI". 

## What will I find here?

Simply put, you will find some character bots that I created either for fun, seeing a request or more. 
> Some bots may have version numbers in their folders but this may not be the case for all. It depends on if I feel like it.

## How do I browse this page?

Simply select the character folder in question and download either their `Scenario` or `No Scenario` version.

Here is the list of bots available
- [Bronya Rand [Honkai: Star Rail (H:SR)]](/%5BHSR%5D%20Bronya%20Rand/)
- [Seele [Honkai: Star Rail (H:SR)]](/%5BHSR%5D%20Seele/)
