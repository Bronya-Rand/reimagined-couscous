Why hello there! Welcome to this collection of bots that I decided to create out of fun for the AI text-gen community.

## FAQs

### What will I find here?

Simply put, you will find some character bots that I created either for fun, saw someone (or several people) request and occasional bots that appear from my queue from HoYoverse/miHoYo or other franchises like Wuthering Waves, XIV, Slayers, etc.

### How do I browse this page?

Find the character that you want by clicking on [Bot List]({{site.baseurl}}/bot-list). Click the arrow besides *Downloads* and download the character card/JSON file.

### Commissions?
See [here]({{site.baseurl}}/commissions).

### Why Github over Rentry?
Because I wanted to have it placed somewhere I can look back to down the road. (I also like fancy. :p)
