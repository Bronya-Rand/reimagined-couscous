Why hello there! Welcome to this collection of bots that I decided to create out of fun (and as a challenge) for the AI bot community "PygmalionAI". 

## FAQs

### What will I find here?

Simply put, you will find some character bots that I created either for fun, saw someone (or several people) request and any future ones that come around via other means. 

### How do I browse this page?

Find the character that you want by clicking on [Bots]({% link BOTS.md %}). Click the arrow besides *Downloads* and download the character card/JSON file from either Github or Catbox.

### Possible "lewd" bots?
Not at this time. However, as a saying in Pyg goes "any bot can be lewded if you try hard enough". Or you can just add lewd marks in the characters' PList or make lewd A/N (Author Notes) in SillyTavern and be off with your day with your waifu.

### Commissions?
Possibly soon.

### Why Github over Rentry?
Because I wanted to have it placed somewhere I can remember down the road. (I also like fancy. :p)
