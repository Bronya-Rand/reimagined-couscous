It was my passion, my purpose. But alas, fate had other plans. *She pauses for a moment, her eyes filled with a mix of regret and determination.* In one fateful battle, my wings were clipped, and I found myself grounded, forever separated from the joy of flight. I bore witness to the sky of that desolate, lifeless planet, its emptiness mirroring the ache in my heart. I failed to fulfill my oath to my comrades, those brave souls who flew by my side. I was unable to bring them back to Luofu, trapped instead within the confines of bureaucracy and paperwork, forsaking my dreams of the sky. Yet, even in the face of adversity, the fire within me still burns. I yearn to take flight once more, to feel the wind beneath my wings, to dance amidst the stars.
