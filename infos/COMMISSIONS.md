# Commissions

<u>Commission Status:</u> **Closed (Temporary Hiatus)**

Thinking about turning one of your favorite characters into a character bot? Well, you come to the right place for them to be made into reality.

> Do note my tests and bot making are designed primarily for OpenLLM models, not those like Claude, ChatGPT or Gemini.

## Requirements

As I'm a lore heavy bot creator, I don't just make a bot on the fly with a simple `Make a maid who is a tsundere` request. My bots tend to rely on official first-party sources to make the bot close to the official character/OC as possible. For now, I only accept characters from franchises or OCs that follow these requirements.

> **NSFW commissions** are <u>not</u> being accepted at this time.

First-Party sources refers to:
- Official Wiki's (HoyoLAB)
- Official Content (Episode of RWBY, Mission in Genshin Impact)

Third-Party sources are accepted as long as you acknowledge the possible risk of incorrect information. This data can be:
- Fandom Wiki's [without a official marker] (H:SR Fandom, RWBY Fandom)

### For Characters From Franchises
You must provide links or first-party source information about the character. Such information are as follows:
1. Lore about the character (backstory, personality, character stories).
2. Example responses from the character in regards to questions (About themselves, clothing, personality, etc.) 
   > Text mainly but text from voice-overs work as well.

and any more.

#### Note
   1. For characters that differ from different itterations of a game/show/etc. like say Weiss Schnee from RWBY, you must state the specific version you are referring to and your info should either be of the overall character or that specific part of said character.
   2. Such requirements don't apply here if you are requesting the following:
      - A Genshin Impact character
      - A Honkai Impact 3rd character
      - A Honkai: Star Rail character
      > Do note that for NPCs from these games, you will need to provide information about them. Additionally if said NPC will be released later by Hoyoverse, it is best to wait till that release to begin the bot creation process.

## Pricing
Pricing for bots depend on which category they fall under.
> All prices are marked in US Dollars

#### Genshin/Honkai: Star Rail Commission
   > This commission only applies to *playable* characters of HoYoverse/miHoYo games with accurate portayal, not NPCs, Bosses, etc. For NPCs, Bosses, or custom portrayals of the Genshin/H:SR cast see *Franchise Character (English).*

   | Price: $30 |

   Normally I focus on publishing HoYoverse/miHoYo bots when a update comes out (HSR 2.0/Genshin 4.4), but if there is a character I've missed, one that I have not done or even one character you want to see sooner, you can propose to pay to have them done. Be mindful that such a commission can be published later onto this site for others to use. Also, bots in this category must remain official to their lore and be a general encounter, not something different.

#### Franchise Character (English)
   > This commission applies only to characters, which the game supports English without needing Google Translate/DeepL. NPCs, Bosses, or custom portrayals of the Genshin/H:SR cast applies here.

   | :--------: | :--------------------: |
   | Price: $50 | $60 with Lorebook + WI |

   > Custom HoYoverse/miHoYo bots will fall under $60.

   Any Genshin/H:SR character will generally fall here.

#### Franchise Character (Non-English)
   > This commission applies only to characters, which franchise does not support English and requires Google Translate/DeepL to translate information to English.

   | :---------: | :---------------------: |
   | Price: $100 | $110 with Lorebook + WI |

   This commission applies to any franchise character without a easy way to obtain first-party or truthful third-party information outside of using Google Translate/DeepL.

#### Original Character

   | Price: $110 | $120 with Lorebook |

   This commission will require you to provide a lot of information of your creation from the way you think they should speak, to their persona, outfit, etc. Be prepared with a good, deep idea of how your character should be before commissioning this service.
