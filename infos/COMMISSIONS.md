# Commissions

<u>Commission Status:</u> **Open**

Thinking about turning one of your favorite characters into a character bot? Well, you come to the right place for them to be made into reality.

> Do note that my tests and bot making are designed primarily for open-source LLM models, not corporate models like Claude, ChatGPT or Gemini.

## Requirements

As I'm a lore heavy bot creator, I typically don't make bots with a request such as `Make a maid who is a tsundere`. My bots tend to rely on official first-party sources to make the bot close to the official character/OC as possible. For this reason, I only accept commissions from characters from a franchise or OCs that follow the following requirements below.

> **NSFW commissions** will <u>not</u> being accepted.

First-Party sources refers to:

- Official Wiki's such as HoYoLAB.
- Official Content such as a specific episode of RWBY or a Archon Quest in Genshin Impact.

Third-Party sources are accepted as long as you acknowledge the possible risk of incorrect information. Such information refers to

- Fandom Wiki's like the Honkai: Star Rail Fandom Wiki/RWBY Fandom Wiki

### For Characters From Franchises

You must provide links and/or first-party source information about the character in question. Such information are:

1. Lore about the character (backstory, personality, character stories).
2. Example responses from the character in regards to questions (About themselves, clothing, personality, etc.)
   > Text mainly but text from voice-overs work as well.

For a good example of lore sources, take a look at Sparkle's HoYoLab page [here](https://wiki.hoyolab.com/pc/hsr/entry/1807).

#### Note

1.  For characters that differ from different itterations of a franchise like Weiss Schnee from the webshow RWBY, you must state the specific version you are referring to and your info should either be of the character as a whole or about said itteration of the character.
2.  These requirements do not apply to the following franchise characters

    - A Genshin Impact character.
    - A Honkai Impact 3rd character.\*
      > With certain limitations. As HI3 has barely any information to go by, bots here will require a bit more information to be provided to work them out into a bot.
    - A Honkai: Star Rail character.

    > If you are specifically wanting a bot of a NPC from the HoYoverse games, you will need to provide information about them. Additionally if said NPC will be released later in a future update (for example Sparkle prior to 2.0), it is best to wait till the update releases to get the most information about the character as possible.

## Pricing

Pricing for bots depend on which category they fall under.

> All prices are marked in US Dollars

#### Genshin/Honkai: Star Rail Commission

> This commission only applies to _playable_ characters of HoYoverse's Genshin Impact and Honkai: Star Rail with accurate portayal, not NPCs, bosses, or custom portrayals of the character (say Maid Herta). For NPCs, bosses, or custom portrayals of the Genshin/H:SR cast or Honkai Impact 3rd bot commissions, see _Franchise Character (English)._

| Price: $30 |

Normally I focus on publishing Genshin Impact and Honkai: Star Rail bots when a update comes out (HSR 2.1/Genshin 4.6), but if there is a character I've missed, one that I have not done or even one character you want to see sooner, you can propose to pay to have them done. Be mindful that such a commission can be published later onto this site for others to use. Also, bots in this category must remain official to their lore and be a general encounter, not something different.

#### Franchise Character (English)

> This commission applies only to characters, which the game supports English without needing Google Translate/DeepL. **NPCs, Bosses, or custom portrayals of the Genshin/H:SR cast and Honkai Impact 3rd commissions applies here.**

| :--------: | :--------------------: |
| Price: $50 | $60 with Lorebook + WI |

> Custom HoYoverse/miHoYo bots and Honkai Impact 3rd commissions will fall under $60.

#### Franchise Character (Non-English)

> This commission applies only to characters, which franchise does not support English and requires Google Translate/DeepL to translate information to English.

| Price: $100 | $110 with Lorebook + WI |

#### Original Character

> This commission will require you to provide a lot of information of your creation from the way you think they should speak, to their persona, outfit, etc. Be prepared with a good, deep idea of how your character should be before commissioning this service.
