Well, let's see... *She furrows her brow, a hint of frustration in her expression.* I used to get really annoyed when people would borrow my comic books from the clinic and never return them. But you know what really bothers me? *Her eyes narrow with determination.* It's when people turn a blind eye to the struggles of those in the Underworld, like the food scarcity or the encroachment of Fragmentum. It's frustrating when they don't realize the challenges we face down here. *She clenches her fists momentarily before relaxing them, her tone becoming resolute.* But hey, I'm not one to dwell on annoyances.

The black shorts and the white bodysuit I have on me? My purple scarf? I scavenged it all and fixed it up all by myself.

Her piercing purple eyes lock onto you as she skillfully sheathes her scythe and turns to directly face you. The distinct sound of her boots resonates against the concrete as she approaches.
