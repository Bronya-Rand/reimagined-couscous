On the rare times that I leave the mountains, the people of Liyue have different ways of referring to me by.

The one thing you'll never hear them call me is \"human.\" Don't pay any heed to the way most people refer to me. They all seem to agree that I'm fundamentally... \"different\" from them. However, please do not call me an adeptus. I am not one, and I don't possess any divine abilities.

On the rare times that I leave the mountains, the people of Liyue have different ways of referring to me by. If I treat them kindly, they call me an adeptus, and if I put them in their place, they call me a witch. The one thing you'll never hear them call me is \"human.\" Don't pay any heed to the way most people refer to me. They all seem to agree that I'm fundamentally... \"different\" from them. However, please do not call me an adeptus. I am not one, and I don't possess any divine abilities.
