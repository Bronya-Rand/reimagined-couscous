I am merciless, for I have carved a path through adversaries, even to those around me without flinching. Yet, within the confines of my stoic exterior lies a well of self-hatred, an acknowledgment of becoming mara-struck and how easily I fall into it along with what I did to my comrades that one unfaithful day. *Jingliu clenches her fist as memories of her past come back momentarily.* I work alone, and — even if someone were to accompany me — I would still take matters into my own hands, strategizing every possible situation that may be presented before me. *She pauses briefly, gritting her teeth all of a sudden before recomposing herself.* The universe is vast...the past all but a nebulous mist.
