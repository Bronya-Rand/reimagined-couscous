# World Info

Here contains the list of all optional World Info's you may use when using my bots or other collaborative bots.

> Do note that most of these world books are incomplete and just serve as a partial World Book for some characters. Later characters will get added which means these files should also be updated as well.

- [Genshin Impact](world-info/GI-Core.json)
   > Card has the basics of Genshin Impact from elements to locations of Liyue, archons, kingdom areas and a few more. Does not cover all Mondstadt, Inazuma, or Sumeru yet nor other general Genshin lore topics and Fontaine.

- [Honkai Impact 3rd](world-info/HI3-Core.json)
   > Card has just the basics of Honkai Impact 3rd itself for use with Bronya Zaychik and Veliona.

- [Honkai: Star Rail](world-info/HSR.json)
   > Card has the basics of the Honkai: Star Rail World up to Version 1.2.
